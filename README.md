## Business Impact: 
1) Identified target 2700+ customers ie 67% of the total number of customers who are most likely to adopt to credit card based on their spending pattern.
2) Identified the high income utilization cities and performed campaigns which lead to a conversion rate of 18-22 % for example: mumbai has 25.55% income utilization ie 4% more than the average and industry benchmarks have shown that
   3-5% growth in income utilization can result in 18-22% conversion rates.
   
   Conversion Rate = The percentage of targeted potential customers who successfully apply for and are approved for a credit card (or a specific type of credit card, like a high-limit card).
                   
4) Identified the peak spending quarter in the year which could lead to 12-15% growth in conversion rates (estimate) because people spend more in that quarter maybe due to sales like amazom and flipkart bbd sales.
5) Issued high-limit cards to top spenders, generating ₹50+ Lakh in annual interest and fee-based revenue by
    Assuming a 10% growth in credit card usage, total spend rises to ₹237.6M (initially 216M + 10% ).
   
    Assuming a 10% revolve rate(customer who revolve and convert to emi) and 6.5% APR, (₹237.6M×10%=₹23.76M, ₹23.76M×6.5%=₹1.5444M=₹15.44L) interest revenue would be ₹15.44L annually.
   
    Additionally, POS charges from merchants (at 1.5% MDR ₹237.6M × 1.5%) would yield ₹35.64L.
   
    Together, Mitron Bank can expect over ₹51L in annual credit card-related revenue.
